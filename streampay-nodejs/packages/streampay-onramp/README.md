## ðŸ‘‰ Features

 - **User Interface (UI)**: The admin dashboard and web user will be built using StreamPayments UI, providing a modern and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and management of the CMS.

 - **CMS, Admin, and API Functionality**: The admin dashboard will serve as a comprehensive solution by combining content management system (CMS), administrative tasks, and API generation capabilities in one platform.

 - **Multi-Vendor/Store Management**: With this CMS, you can efficiently manage multiple vendors or stores within a single interface. For example, you can have separate sections for a "Shoe store," "Laptop store," and "Suit store." Each store's data will be organized individually with dedicated API routes generated automatically.

 - **Category Management**: You can create, update, and delete categories to organize your products effectively. This feature allows for easy categorization of items based on their types or attributes.

 - **Product Management**: Easily handle product-related tasks such as creating new products, updating existing ones with details like name, description, price, etc., as well as deleting products when necessary.

 - **Image Uploads & Customization**: Users can upload multiple images per product and change them whenever required to showcase different views or variants of the item.

 - **Filter Creation & Integration:**: Create custom filters such as "Color" or "Size" that align with your specific product attributes. These filters can then be seamlessly integrated into the product creation form for efficient matching during search queries.

 - **Comprehensive Search Functionality**: A powerful search feature allows users to explore through all categories along with their associated products' sizes/colors/billboards. The search results are presented with pagination for easy navigation.

 - **Featured Products**: Highlight specific products by marking them as "featured" so that they appear on the homepage or other prominent sections of your website, increasing their visibility to potential customers.

 - **Order Management**: Access and track all orders placed through the system, providing a comprehensive overview of sales and customer transactions.

 - **Revenue Analytics**: Visualize revenue data through graphs and charts, enabling you to analyze sales performance over time and make informed business decisions based on this information.

 - **Stripe Checkout Integration with USDC**: Seamlessly integrate with Stripe Checkout, a popular payment gateway, to enable smooth and secure online transactions for your customers. Users can easily make payments using various payment methods supported by Stripe.

 - **MySQL + Prisma + PlanetScale**: Utilize MySQL as the database management system along with Prisma ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for efficient data modeling and querying capabilities. Leverage PlanetScale's distributed SQL database platform for scalability and high availability of your data storage infrastructure.

### Stripe Fiat-to-Crypto Onramp Usage

This section explains how the Stripe fiat-to-crypto onramp is used in the project. It includes instructions on installing the SDK and client library, generating a crypto onramp session, rendering the onramp UI on the website, and viewing usage on the Stripe Dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and dependencies:

- **stripe/crypto** The Stripe fiat-to-crypto onramp enables individuals to securely purchase cryptocurrencies directly from your platform or Dapp at the time of checkout. The onramp is fully customizable and you can integrate it into your product or service. Stripe acts as the merchant of record for these onramp transactions and takes full liability for all fraud and disputes. Stripe also handles all regulatory requirements, know your customer (KYC) verifications, and sanctions screening. Customers have the option of saving payment methods, KYC data, and wallet information with Stripe, which makes the returning onramp experience much faster.

- **Next 13 (App Router)** The version 13 of Next.js, which includes the new App Router feature for client-side navigation within the application. This allows for smoother transitions between pages without full page reloads.

- **Tailwind CSS** A highly customizable CSS framework that offers utility classes for rapid UI development.

- **Prisma** An open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access with its type-safe query builder, schema migrations, and data modeling features.

- **TypeScript** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability.

- **MySQL** An open-source relational database management system used to store structured data efficiently.

- **@clerk/nextjs** Clerk is a user authentication and identity management solution. The "@clerk/nextjs" package provides integration with Next.js, allowing you to easily implement authentication features like login, logout, and role-based access control in your application.

- **recharts** Recharts is a charting library for React that offers a wide range of customizable charts such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc. It allows you to visualize data in an interactive and visually appealing way.

- **zustand** Zustand is a state management library for React applications that offers a lightweight yet powerful alternative to Redux or MobX by leveraging hooks and functional programming concepts.

## How Stripe fiat-to-crypto onramp is being used

In the Store website, the **Stripe fiat-to-crypto onramp** is utilized to facilitate the payment process and enable seamless transactions for purchasing digital content.

- Install the SDK and client library..

- Generate a crypto onramp session on your backend.

- Render the onramp UI on your website.

- View your integrationâ€™s usage on the Stripe Dashboard.

1. Install the SDK and client library

```sh
npm install --save @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/crypto
```

2. Generate a crypto onramp session

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \
  -u sk_test_51NXOHdARfU5KPLlVvSdDo9Y0zQXLkfS1vMj3AhYNU8A22W7rprb5YJTCDNfgaQeAl58yzZ8mMa3eBUD3EEWpdZiC00LD2YWcQA:
  # this secret key is from step 1
```

3. Render the Onramp UI

```sh
# App.jsx
import {loadStripeOnramp} from '@stripe/crypto';

import {CryptoElements, OnrampElement} from './StripeCryptoElements';

const stripeOnrampPromise = loadStripeOnramp("pk_test_51NXOHdARfU5KPLlVkKLfC8cLyGoElI4ruwGVRhpKLb49CYPRicAYBj1fPT6VFlQHK8US7tYKhxYqKdErqdY6iNFA00jHYWcJhr");

export default () => {
  // IMPORTANT: replace with your logic of how to mint/retrieve client secret
  const clientSecret = "cos_1Lb6vsAY1pjOSNXVWF3nUtkV_secret_8fuPvTzBaxj3XRh14C6tqvdl600rpW7hG4G";

  return (
    <CryptoElements stripeOnramp={stripeOnrampPromise}>
      <OnrampElement clientSecret={clientSecret} />
    </CryptoElements>
  );
}
# StripeCryptoElements.jsx
import React, { ReactNode } from 'react';

// ReactContext to simplify access of StripeOnramp object
const CryptoElementsContext = React.createContext(null);

export const CryptoElements = ({
  stripeOnramp,
  children,
}) => {
  const [ctx, setContext] = React.useState(() => ({ onramp: null }));

  React.useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;

    Promise.resolve(stripeOnramp).then((onramp) => {
      if (onramp && isMounted) {
        setContext((ctx) => (ctx.onramp ? ctx : { onramp }));
      }
    });

    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, [stripeOnramp]);

  return (
    <CryptoElementsContext.Provider value={ctx}>
      {children}
    </CryptoElementsContext.Provider>
  );
};

// React hook to get StripeOnramp from context
export const useStripeOnramp = () => {
  const context = React.useContext(CryptoElementsContext);
  return context?.onramp;
};

// React element to render Onramp UI
export const OnrampElement = ({
  clientSecret,
  appearance,
  ...props
}) => {
  const stripeOnramp = useStripeOnramp();
  const onrampElementRef = React.useRef(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const containerRef = onrampElementRef.current;
    if (containerRef) {
      containerRef.innerHTML = '';

      if (clientSecret && stripeOnramp) {
        stripeOnramp
          .createSession({
            clientSecret,
            appearance,
          })
          .mount(containerRef)
      }
    }
  }, [clientSecret, stripeOnramp]);

  return <div {...props} ref={onrampElementRef}></div>;
};
```

After running the script, the onramp renders the following:
